# US-Air-Transport-Operation-Analysis-from-2009-to-2018

**Project Objective**

As passengers, each of us experiences flight delays for various reasons at major airports. Even for popular airlines, large airports, they are not immune.
Through this project, we aimed to identify the most popular airlines and the busiest airports in the United States, then through different angles located in two main directions: airlines and airports, to better understand the operation of the aviation industry in the past ten years. After that, we give our suggestions to improve operational efficiency.

**Motivation**

Flight delay has always been a problem that the aviation industry has to face. We hope that through this analysis, we can look at the problem of flight delay from the two perspectives of airlines and airports. Through the comparison between airports and airlines, airlines and airlines to find out the direction of airlines and airports can be optimized, as well as the problems exposed.
